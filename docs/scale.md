## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Architecture (Baseline)

**Assumptions:**

- Monolithic or simple microservice setup
- Synchronous API calls to OMDb
- Single PostgreSQL DB
- Spring Boot backend
- Stateless REST APIs with basic auth
- Deployed on a single-node instance or minimal auto-scaling group

This setup is manageable for low traffic (e.g., 100‚Äì10k daily users) but will buckle under high load without
enhancement.

## üöÄ Scaling for 10M Daily Users ‚Äî High-Level Changes

### 1. API Gateway & Load Balancing

- Add API Gateway (e.g., NGINX, Spring Cloud Gateway, AWS API Gateway) to:
    - Route requests efficiently
    - Apply rate limiting, throttling
    - Support A/B testing and canary releases
- Use Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Kubernetes Ingress Controller for horizontal distribution of traffic.

### 2. Horizontal Scaling with Kubernetes

- Containerize the application using Docker and deploy with Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS).
- Auto-scale pods based on CPU/memory utilization or custom metrics like request count.
- Use HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) and cluster auto-scaling to handle peak loads.

### 3. Caching Layer

- Introduce Redis or Memcached:
    - Cache frequently accessed movie data (e.g., OMDb responses)
    - Cache top-rated movie list (updated hourly or via background job)
- Use Cache Aside pattern or Spring Cache abstraction for seamless integration.

### 4. Database Optimization & Scaling

- Move from a single-node DB to a read-write split:
    - Primary DB for writes
    - Read replicas (PostgreSQL/Aurora) for read scaling
- Use connection pools (e.g., HikariCP) and tune queries/indexes
- Eventually consider sharding if data grows significantly (e.g., user ratings table)

### 5. Asynchronous Processing with Message Queues

- Decouple synchronous flows:
    - Use Kafka to queue rating submissions
    - Persist ratings asynchronously via worker consumers
- This helps handle bursts and protects the DB from overload.

### 6. External API Resilience (OMDb)

- Rate limit and backoff external API calls using Resilience4j or Spring Retry
- Use circuit breakers to avoid cascading failures
- Optionally, replicate OMDb data into a local cache or datastore if API latency becomes a bottleneck

### 7. Observability & Monitoring

- Integrate:
    - Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
    - ELK stack for centralized logging
    - Jaeger for tracing
- Set up alerts on latency, error rates, queue size, etc.

### 8. CI/CD & Feature Flags

- Use feature flags (e.g. Unleash) to release features gradually
