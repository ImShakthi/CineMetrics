# CineMetric üé¶

This service integrates with the OMDb API and a provided CSV file to fetch and store movie details locally. It can also
determine whether a given movie title won the Best Picture award. The application supports user management (creation and
deletion), JWT-based authentication (login and logout), movie ratings, and provides an endpoint to retrieve the top 10
highest-rated movies, ranked by box office revenue.

## Core features

- Determine whether a given movie title won the Best Picture award using data from a CSV file
- Fetch movie details from the OMDb API
- Store user ratings on a scale of 1 to 100 (one rating per user per movie)
- Retrieve all ratings for a specific movie title
- List the top **N** highest-rated movies, ranked by box office revenue
- Create and delete user accounts, with JWT based authentication

### üìÅ Environment Variable Setup

The application relies on environment variables for configuration. You can set them in a .env file at the project root.

üìù Example .env file

``` env

JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=sample-jasypt-encrypt-passwd

SPRING_REDIS_HOST=redis
SPRING_REDIS_PORT=6379
```

_‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to keep sensitive keys (like JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD) secure and private. Never commit them to version
control._
